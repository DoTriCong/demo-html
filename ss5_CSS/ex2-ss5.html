        later re-calibrating her image from country to pop with the synth-pop
        <br />
        set 1989 (2014); the ensuing media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-imbued
        Reputation (2017). The albums contained the Billboard Hot 100 number one
        singles "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together"<br />
        " Shake It Off. "Blank Space". "Bad Blood" and "Look What You Made Me
